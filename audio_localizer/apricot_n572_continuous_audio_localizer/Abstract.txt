LED is off when sound detection is turned off.
LED is low when detection is turned on, but sound detected is not above threshold.
LED is high when sound detected is above threshold.
Sets GPIOB 12 when sound detected is above threshold. Stays high until cleared by spi command.

Implements the following spi protocol:
[command] [data0] ... [dataN]
STM -> N572 

set threshold
0x01 [threshold_byte]

enable/disable sound detection
0x02 [enable/disable_boolean (0x00 = disable, 0x01 = enable)]

get sound db.
0x03 0x00 0x00 (read 12 bit int average of sound amplitude received over past 1/8 second, expressed in raw adc voltage)

clear interrupt. (lower GPIOB 12).
0x04

N572 -> STM
interrupt when sound detected. (rise interrupt gpio)
