Implements the following spi protocol:
[command] [data0] ... [dataN]
STM -> N572 

set threshold
0x01 [threshold_byte]

enable/disable sound detection
0x02 [enable/disable_boolean (0x00 = disable, 0x01 = enable)]

get sound db.
0x03 0x00 0x00 (read 12 bit int average of sound amplitude received over past 1/8 second, expressed in raw adc voltage)

clear interrupt. (lower GPIOB 12).
0x04

N572 -> STM
interrupt when sound detected. (rise interrupt gpio)

There are 4 demos:

SET_THRESHOLD_DEMO:
Sets the sound threshold on n572.
Adjust #define SOUND_THRESHOLD and rerun to update threshold on n572. 
The higher the value, the more sound is required to turn the n572 LED fully on.
SOUND_THRESHOLD may be set between 0x00 and 0xff.


TOGGLE_DETECTION_DEMO:
Turns on sound detection on N572 and turns it off every 500 milliseconds.


RECEIVE_THRESHOLD_DEMO:
Requests current sound volume periodically. If that volume is larger than 
SOUND_THRESHOLD (which can be different from threshold for n572), STM LED
will turn on.


INTERRUPT_LINE_DEMO:
Will blink the STM LED while interrupt line (AUDIO_TRIANGULATION_BIT0, GPIOB 15) is high.
Will also tell N572 to lower interrupt line once it sees that the line is high.
